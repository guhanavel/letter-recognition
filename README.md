# Letter Recognition

This project aims to recognize letters using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle and trains a model using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Introduction

The Letter Recognition project is a machine learning-based system that can identify letters from an input image. It employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn features from the dataset and predict the correct letter.

This project serves as a demonstration of using Keras and TensorFlow to build and train an image recognition model. It can be extended to recognize handwritten letters, classify characters in different languages, or be integrated into larger applications.

## Installation
