# Letter Recognition

This project aims to recognize letters using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset from Kaggle and trains a model using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Introduction
The Letter Recognition project is a machine learning-based system that can identify letters from an input image. It employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn features from the dataset and predict the correct letter.

This project serves as a demonstration of using Keras and TensorFlow to build and train an image recognition model. It can be extended to recognize handwritten letters, or be integrated into larger applications. This was a subproject in progress when I was pursuing my first startup idea of creating a software that digitizes my notes. However, after completing this component, I realized my lack of technical acumen and decided to drop this project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

   Clone the repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/guhanavel/letter-recognition.git```

## Usage
To use the letter recognition system, follow these steps:
   1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
   2. Run the handwriting jupyter source file
   3. If you want to fine tune the model, feel free to edit layer1.py file
